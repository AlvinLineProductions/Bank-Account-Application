# Bank-Account-Application
A bank account application where you can create an application to handle new bank account requests.
The application should do of the following: 
  1.) Read a .CSV file of names, social security numbers, account type, and initial deposit
  2.) Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts
  3.) Savings Account Holders are given a Safety Deposit Box, identified by a 3-digit number and accessed with a 4-digit-code
  4.) Checking accounts are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN
  5.) Both accounts will use an interface that determines the base interest rate
  
A .CSV file is attached here as an example to see what the format looks like.
